# Pine
An environmental app built to bring people together

Website: https://pine.jonathan2018.repl.co/

## Inspiration
Pine functions a lot like a social media app. However, it brings many people together to do something that'll help the environment.

## What it does
Pine provides a platform for people to post environmental events such as, trash pickups, tree planting, and more. Anyone on the website can discover these projects and choose to participate in them. This is a great way to get people to volunteer for the environment. Additionally, hosting an event on Pine doesn't only help the environment in one way, but it also reduces the paper used. Instead of printing hundreds of flyers or sending letters, it's easy to post a project on Pine and have other people discover it online. Therefore, it is an inexpensive and paperless solution to helping the environment.

## How we built it
The website is mostly built with Python, HTML, and CSS. It is hosted on [Replit](https://replit.com).
